# download-cleanup-script
## DANGER 
## DO NOT RUN UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND IT

This is a destructive script it will delete all files/folders that don't match its settings in the current directory I am not responsible for you delete your stuff.

It delete any files/folders that are older than a specified number of days in the current directory

It does not look in the sub dir to match names.

# setup
Add the files/folders you wish it to ignore to the ignore list and then set haveConfig to True

This is personal script I have so I can clean out my downloads folder every so often.
